# Vercel "Ignored Build Step" entry point — PROJECT-SCOPED.
#
# Set this as each Vercel project's
#   Settings → Git → Ignored Build Step
# command, passing the scope for that project:
#
#   ifc-lite (viewer)        →  bash scripts/vercel-ignore-build.sh viewer
#   ifc-lite-viewer-embed    →  bash scripts/vercel-ignore-build.sh embed
#   ifc-lite-dev (landing)   →  bash scripts/vercel-ignore-build.sh landing
#
# Why per-scope: all three projects are wired to the same repo, so by
# default EVERY push deploys ALL of them (Vercel monorepo default). The
# heavy viewer / viewer-embed projects each compile Rust + WASM from
# source (rust toolchain + emsdk + cargo, several minutes), and the
# landing page is a static no-op build — yet a pure-geometry Rust PR was
# rebuilding the landing, and a landing copy-edit was spinning up the
# viewer. Scoping each project to the paths it actually consumes is the
# single biggest Vercel build-minute lever for this repo.
# See scripts/README-vercel-cost.md for the full cost rationale.
#
# Vercel runs the script for every push. Per the Vercel docs:
#
#   exit 0  → skip the deploy (no build minutes charged)
#   exit 1  → run the deploy as normal
#   any other → run the deploy as normal
#
# The default decision when in doubt is to DEPLOY (exit 1), so this is
# conservative — a false negative wastes a build, a false positive ships
# a stale deploy.
#
# Pairs with Turbo Remote Cache (auto-enabled on Vercel builds): Turbo
# handles per-task cache hits when something relevant changed; this
# script handles the no-op case where Vercel would otherwise spin up a
# fresh build container only to find every task cached (or nothing to do).

# Run from the git repo root so the pathspecs below resolve correctly no
# matter which Root Directory a Vercel project sets — Vercel invokes the
# Ignored Build Step from the project's Root Directory, and the embed
# project's root is `apps/viewer-embed`, not the repo root. Fall back to the
# current dir if we're somehow not in a git work tree (git diff then fails
# closed → DEPLOY, the safe default).

# commit that ISN'T in Vercel's shallow clone — `git diff` then dies with
# "fatal: bad object <sha>", the check fails, and we deploy every time
# (never skipping). So only use it when it's actually present in the clone.
