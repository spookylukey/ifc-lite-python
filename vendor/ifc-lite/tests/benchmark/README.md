# Performance Benchmarking Guide

This directory contains performance benchmarks for IFC-Lite geometry processing and rendering.

## Quick Start

### Run Default Benchmark

```bash
# Build viewer first
pnpm --filter viewer build

# Fetch one small fixture on demand
git lfs pull --include="tests/models/ara3d/AC20-FZK-Haus.ifc"

# Run a single small benchmark (headed browser for accurate GPU timing)
VIEWER_BENCHMARK_FILES="tests/models/ara3d/AC20-FZK-Haus.ifc" pnpm test:benchmark:viewer
```

### Run Additional Models

```bash
VIEWER_BENCHMARK_FILES="tests/models/ara3d/AC20-FZK-Haus.ifc" pnpm test:benchmark:viewer
```

You can provide a comma-separated list, but only after pulling the exact fixtures you want to test.

### Optional Stress Tests

The largest fixtures are intentionally opt-in because they consume substantial Git LFS bandwidth:

```bash
git lfs pull --include="tests/models/various/O-S1-BWK-BIM architectural - BIM bouwkundig.ifc,tests/models/ara3d/ISSUE_053_20181220Holter_Tower_10.ifc"
VIEWER_BENCHMARK_FILES="tests/models/various/O-S1-BWK-BIM architectural - BIM bouwkundig.ifc,tests/models/ara3d/ISSUE_053_20181220Holter_Tower_10.ifc" pnpm test:benchmark:viewer
```

### Check for Regressions

```bash
# After running benchmarks, check against baseline
pnpm benchmark:check
```

## Test Models

The benchmark suite includes 4 models covering different scenarios:

| Model | Size | Purpose | Key Metrics |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| **FZK-Haus** | 2.4MB | Cutout/boolean testing | Window/door openings must be visible |
| **Snowdon Towers** | 8.3MB | Structural elements | Fast loading baseline |
| **BWK-BIM** | 326.8MB | Large architectural | Optional stress test for streaming |
| **Holter Tower** | 169.2MB | Complex geometry | Optional stress test for crash prevention (MAX_OPENINGS safeguard) |

For day-to-day work, prefer `FZK-Haus` or `Snowdon Towers`. Reserve `BWK-BIM` and `Holter Tower` for intentional stress testing.

## Establishing Baseline

1. **Run benchmarks on clean branch** (e.g., main):
   ```bash
   git lfs pull --include="tests/models/ara3d/AC20-FZK-Haus.ifc,tests/models/various/01_Snowdon_Towers_Sample_Structural(1).ifc"
   VIEWER_BENCHMARK_FILES="tests/models/ara3d/AC20-FZK-Haus.ifc,tests/models/various/01_Snowdon_Towers_Sample_Structural(1).ifc" pnpm test:benchmark:viewer
   ```

2. **Copy results to baseline.json**:
   ```bash
   # Results are saved to tests/benchmark/benchmark-results/
   # Manually copy metrics to tests/benchmark/baseline.json
   ```

3. **Commit baseline.json** - This becomes the reference for regression detection.

## Metrics Captured

Primary metrics captured in the current benchmark log format:

- **firstBatchWaitMs**: Time until first geometry appears (user-perceived speed)
- **totalWallClockMs**: End-to-end load time for the model
- **totalMeshes**: Total mesh count (geometry correctness check)
- **fileSizeMB**: Model size used for comparisons
- **wasmWaitMs**: Total WASM processing wait time during geometry streaming
- **entityScanMs**: Fast entity scanning time
- **dataModelParseMs**: Data model parse time

## Geometry Correctness Validation

The benchmark suite includes mesh count validation to detect geometry regressions:

- **Expected mesh counts** are defined in `viewer-benchmark.spec.ts`
- **Tolerance**: 5% variance allowed
- **Warning**: Logs warning if mesh count differs significantly (may indicate missing cutouts)

## Performance Targets

Baseline updated from local run on 2026-02-21:

| Model | First Geometry (`firstBatchWaitMs`) | Total Time (`totalWallClockMs`) | WASM Wait (`wasmWaitMs`) | Meshes |
|-------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| FZK-Haus | ~202ms | ~0.25s | ~14ms | 244 |
| Snowdon | ~217ms | ~0.59s | ~292ms | 1,556 |
| BWK-BIM | ~5.43s | ~11.89s | ~2.98s | 39,146 |
| Holter | ~3.05s | ~11.04s | ~5.60s | 108,551 |

## CI Integration

Viewer benchmark CI mode is available via:

```bash
git lfs pull --include="tests/models/ara3d/AC20-FZK-Haus.ifc"
VIEWER_BENCHMARK_FILES="tests/models/ara3d/AC20-FZK-Haus.ifc" pnpm test:benchmark:viewer:ci
```

This runs headless with software rendering (`--use-angle=swiftshader`) and is useful for reproducible CI-style timing checks.

## Troubleshooting

**Benchmarks fail with "No baseline available"**:
- Fetch the fixtures you want to baseline, then run `VIEWER_BENCHMARK_FILES="..." pnpm test:benchmark:viewer` and copy the results into `baseline.json`

**Performance regressions detected**:
- Check if optimizations broke geometry (mesh count validation)
- Profile WASM with browser DevTools Performance tab
- Compare console logs between baseline and current run

**Geometry correctness warnings**:
- Verify cutouts are visible in FZK-Haus model
- Check if MAX_OPENINGS safeguard is skipping too much
- Ensure CSG operations complete successfully
